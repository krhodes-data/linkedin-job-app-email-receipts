A simple script to parse my email inbox, searching for the "receipt" email after applying to a job on LinkedIn. For the ones that are found, it adds them to a Google Sheet for simpler tracking and then deletes the email (to reduce inbox clutter).


Future ideas:
- parse email body for link to job description
- automate - trigger-based on email being received, or just at a set timeframe?
